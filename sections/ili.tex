\section{Influenza-like-Illness Forecasting}
In this section we analyze the forecasts generated for Influenza-like-Illness
or ILI events. For ILI, we concentrated on short-term forecasts for the first 
2 years of \EMBERS. We shited our focus to long-term forecasts for the subsequent
years. We analyze both types of forecast here for general performance and 
analyze in details a few succesful forecasts which showcased the strength 
our system. There were a number of \EMBERS~ILI forecasts which significantly
deviated from the target sources. We analyzed these scenarios and discuss in 
details some of the weakness of \EMBERS. These scenarios also helped us to 
increase the robustness of our system.

  \item {\bf Short-term:} ILI case counts for Chile for event date 08/07/13.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Actual value: 626
      \item First update: 581 (QS: 3.71)
