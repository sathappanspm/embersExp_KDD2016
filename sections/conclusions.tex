\section{Conclusions}
We have presented our experiences and lessons learnt from operating EMBERS
continuously 24x7 over a period of four years.
EMBERS has proven
itself to be a reliable predictor of civil unrest events in 10 different
countries by ingesting data from multiple
languages. EMBERS has been a wonderful testbed for our data science
team and even in its misses much has been learnt.

Future work falls primarily in three directions.
First, we intend to investigate more formal methods to model precursors
to protests, so that better precursor detection can constitute better
protest forecasting.
Second, we will continue
to build a strong systems capability to forecasting societal events,
by enlarging the scope of regions and languages covered.
Finally, we are investigating
techniques to remove or reduce the human element required in generating 
the GSR. Currently the most human intensive part of the EMBERS project 
is generating a GSR for training and validation of the models.
