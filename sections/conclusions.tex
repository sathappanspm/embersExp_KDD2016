\section{Conclusions}
\narenc{Patrick, please write two paragraphs. One summarizing the ppaer, and one describing future work.}
We have presented the successes as well as the lessons learned from the EMBERS
architecture as a result of four years of 24x7 operation.  EMBERS has shown
itself to be a reliable predictor of civil unrest events in 10 different
countries, and three different major languages.  Yet despite these successes
EMBERS has also been a learning experience and even in its misses much has been
learned.


Future work is divided into three aspects.
First, we want to look at building a stronger ability to predict the confidence
based upon the input from multiple models.  Being able better understand how multiple
alerts from different models could improve or deflate confidence and by how much would
be an invaluable tool to further improve the predicted confidence of an alert.
Second, we want to better understand and detect black swan events as they
occur.  While by their nature it is impossible to predict these events it might
be possible to detect them early on and quickly determine their momentum so
that they can be used to predict society wide side effects..
Finally, we want to look at techniques to remove or reduce the human element required in generating the GSR.  Currently the most human intensive part of the EMBERS program is generating a GSR for training and validation of the models.
