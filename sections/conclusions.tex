\section{Conclusions}
We have presented the successes as well as the lessons learned from the EMBERS
architecture as a result of four years of 24x7 operation.  EMBERS has shown
itself to be a reliable predictor of civil unrest events in 10 different
countries, and three different major languages.  Yet despite these successes
EMBERS has also been a learning experience and even in its misses much has been
learned.

Future work falls primarily in two directions..
First, we will continue
to build a strong capability to forecasting societal events,
leveraging multiple, overlapping,
models of selective superiority.
Being able to better understand how multiple
alerts from different models should be fused would 
be an invaluable tool to analysts.
Secondly, we are investigating
techniques to remove or reduce the human element required in generating 
the GSR.  Currently the most human intensive part of the EMBERS project 
is generating a GSR for training and validation of the models.
