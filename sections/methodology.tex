\section{methodology}

Some of the questions we seek to answer are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item How adept is EMBERS at forecasting rare events? Does the performance
of EMBERS vary with respect to planned versus spontaneous events?
\item What data sources are crucial to forecasting specific classes of
events? How important is social media versus other open sources?
\item How reliant is the EMBERS methodology on coded ground truth
data, i.e., how rapidly does model drift occur?
\end{enumerate}
