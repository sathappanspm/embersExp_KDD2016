\section{Civilunrest Forecasting}
The following section details out some of the successful and not so
successful forecasts made by EMBERS over the past few years in Latin America.
\subsection{Successful Forecasts}
Described below are some examples of successful civilunrest
forecasts made by the EMBERS system during 2013-2015.

\textbf{Brazil Spring (June 2013)}: These protests were the largest and most
significant protests in Brazil`s recent history that caught worldwide
attention. Millions of Brazilians took part in these demonstrations,
also known as the Brazilian Spring or the Vinegar Movement (inspired
from the use of vinegar soaked cloth by demonstrators to protect
themselves from police teargas), which were catalyzed by an increase in
public transport fares from $R\$3$ to $R\$3.20$ by the government of President
Dilma Rousseff.

As shown in Figure.~\ref{fig:brazilJune13} EMBERS, while missing the initial uptick,
captured the increase in the order of magnitude of the protest events
during the Brazilian Spring and also captured
the spatial spread in the events, in addition to forecasting that this would be
a "General Population" protest.

\end{figure}

Around 68\% of EMBERS Brazil alerts resulted from detected planned
protest which can be explained from the fact that the social networking
sites (Twitter and Facebook) and conventional news media played a key
role in organization of these uprisings. Although, initial protests were
mostly against the bus fare increase soon these grew from general
population's deep dissatisfactions to include wider issues such as -
government corruption, over-spending and police brutality. Also,
demonstrators made calls for political reforms. In response, President
Rousseff proposed a referendum on widespread political reforms in
Brazil, but was later abandoned. EMBERS models were able to capture such
discussions on Twitter (see Figure.~\ref{fig:brazilJune13_wordCloud}), and followed these stories as
they evolved through June.

\end{figure}

The protests intensified in late June (see Figure.~\ref{fig:brazilJune13}), which were
captured by EMBERS, as they also coincided with FIFA 2013 Confederations
Cup matches. This was an important factor due to which protests gained
momentum as they were covered by world media. Majority of protests
occurred in those cities, which were hosting (FIFA) soccer matches.
EMBERS submitted most of its alerts for these host cities (see Figure
~\ref{fig:brazilJune13_map}){\textemdash} Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo,
Belo Horizonte, Salvador and Porto Alegre,
among others. For example, on 27th June during Confederations cup
semi-final in Fortaleza, around 5000 protestors clashed with the police
near the Castelao stadium - In this case EMBERS sent out an alert the
day before. Then later on 30th June, when the last games of the
confederation cup took place in Rio de Janeiro and Salvador that were
also plagued by mass protests – EMBERS predicted these events and
submitted multiple alerts for Rio on 28th and 29th June and one for
Salvador on 29th June.

\textbf{Venezuelan Spring (Feb-March 2014)}:
EMBERS captured some of the first `calls to protest` for the trigger city of
San Cristobal and its nearby surrounding areas and correctly forecast the
population (Education) and that the protests would turn violent. Over the next
days, EMBERS closely forecast the spike in the number of events as shown
in Figure.~\ref{fig:venezuelaMarch14} and the spread
of the protests to additional cities as shown in
Figure.~\ref{fig:venezuelaMap}.

\textbf{Mexico Protests (October 2014)}:
EMBERS , as shown in Figure.~\ref{fig:mexicoOct14} forecast an uptick of Mexico
protests during early October 2014 stemming from students and teachers demanding
action on the 43 students missing case, with a lead time of about 3
days. It also generated  a series of alert spikes coinciding with the first
large-scale nationwide protests between October 5th to 8th.

\end{figure}

\textbf{Colombia Protests (December'14 -March'15)}:
EMBERS successfully forecast the uptick in the number of events during the
middle of December 2014 and also the increase in protest counts during February
2015 as shown in Figure.~\ref{fig:colombiaDec14}, though in the latter case EMBERS over predicted the counts. The uptick in
December 2014 was led by the opposition leader Alvaro Uribe against impunity.
Whereas the increase in  protest counts in February 2015
was due to trucker’s strike against increase in fuel price.

\textbf{Paraguay Protests (February 2015)}:
EMBERS forecast the uptick in number of protest events in Paraguay during mid
February 2015 as shown in Figure.~\ref{fig:paraguay15}. The events were mainly due to the lack of opportunity and basic
needs and against the introduction of new public-private partnership law.

\subsection{Events missed by EMBERS}:
The following section details out certain events that EMBERS failed to
capture properly.

\textbf{Brazil Protests (March 2015)}: EMBERS predicted the accurate
increase in the rate of events but does not capture the true counts. The
protests were mainly targeted against president Dilma Rousseff due to
increasing corruption. 

During this period there was a significant architectural change in the
EMBERS processing pipeline. EMBERS had moved to Heideltime temporal
tagger from the previously used TIMEN temporal tagger due to
Heideltime`s support for more languages and active development cycle as
opposed to TIMEN. Heideltime had no support for portuguese (the main
language used in Brazil) and EMBERS team had extended Heideltime to
portuguese by translating the resources for spanish to portuguese. It
turned out that simple translation of rules from spanish to portuguese
were not sufficient and this affected the recall of one of our main
models for Brazil - Planned Protest - as it depended on the quality and recall of
date extraction from text.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.8\columnwidth]{cu/brazilMarch15}
\caption{Brazil 2015 Protests}
\label{fig:brazilSpring}
\end{figure}


\textbf{Mexico December 1, 2014 Protests}:
EMBERS missed the huge single day spike on December 1st when
people turned out in huge numbers in different parts of Mexico demanding
Pena Nieto`s ouster.
EMBERS predicted nationwide events for December 1st but failed to
capture the its spread. 

December 1st was picked by the protestors due to
its historical significance - it was the day when Pena Nieto was sworn
in as President in 2012 amidst much controversy and opposition from
general public. Also another reason for the missed prediction was due to 
EMBERS inability in extracting dates mentioned using twitter lingo  like "\#1Dmx".

\subsection{Surprising Events Predicted by EMBERS}To rigorously evaluate the capabilities of EMBERS, we implemented a baserate model as a yardstick for comparison. The baserate model generates alerts using the rate of occurrence of events in the past three months. While such a model will perform well when the average number of events per month doesn't fluctuate much, it will miss out predictions when there are sudden wide-spread nationwide protest events. 


In order to identify surprising events, we employed a Maximum Entropy Based Approach. For this approach, each event is described using the following three dimensions: Country, Population and Event Type. A three-dimensional cuboid as shown in figure ~\ref{fig:maxent_model} succinctly captures the event distribution across the three dimensions. In the Maximum Entropy Approach, Maximum Likelihood Estimates for each cell of this cuboid is generated while keeping the marginals constant. For any given month, deviations from these MLE estimates are calculated and the cells with maximum deviations are termed as `surprising events cell'.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.7\columnwidth]{cu/maxent_model}
\caption{Maximum Entropy Counts Cuboid}
\label{fig:maxent_model}
\end{figure}

Every month, events from the last three months of GSR is used to populate this event distribution cuboid. Once the cuboid is populated, we apply Iterative Proportional Fitting Procedure\cite{ipfp} to estimate the Maximum Likelihood values for each cell while keeping the marginals constant. The resultant cuboid is then scaled to matched the number of events in the current month. A similar three-dimensional cuboid is generated for the events of the current month and difference is calculated between actual counts and scaled MLE counts for each cell. Subsequently, all the cells with difference greater that 5-sigma are classified as `surprising' and events corresponding to these cells are used to generated a smaller version of GSR called `Surprising GSR'. 

\subsubsection{Iterative Proportional Fitting Procedure (IPFP)}
IPFP was invented in 1940's by Deming and Stephan\cite{deming1940least}. It is used to obtain Maximum Likelihood Estimates for the elementary cells by iterative fitting of the sufficient configurations. The procedure for a three dimensional structure, described in much detail in \cite{bishop2007discrete}, proceeds as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Once the marginals are identified, elementary cells are replaced by 1; $\widehat{m}^{(0)}_{ijk}=1$
\item After initialization, the following three-step iterative cycle is performed till a satisfactory stopping goal is achieved:
$$\widehat{m}^{(c+1)}_{ijk} = \widehat{m}^{(c)}_{ijk}\frac{x_{ij+}}{\widehat{m}^{(c)}_{ij+}}$$
$$\widehat{m}^{(c+2)}_{ijk} = \widehat{m}^{(c+1)}_{ijk}\frac{x_{i+k}}{\widehat{m}^{(c+1)}_{i+k}}$$
$$\widehat{m}^{(c+3)}_{ijk} = \widehat{m}^{(c+2)}_{ijk}\frac{x_{+jk}}{\widehat{m}^{(c)}_{+jk}}$$
where c refers to iteration cycle and `+' refers to summation over a dimension. 
\item The procedure stops if either the desired convergence of $\delta < 0.0001$ is achieved or the maximum number of iterations are reached.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Surprising Events Results}
In table~\ref{tab:maxentEvents} we present several such cases where sudden nationwide events erupted. For all these events, we compare the recall of both EMBERS and baserate model in figure ~\ref{fig:maxent}. While EMBERS is able to pick up `{indicators}' for these protest events, baserate model fails to deliver.
